# Travel Website

This simple travel website is built using a minimum of 5-6 HTML5 tags, with the goal of creating a presentable and visually appealing layout.

### HTML5 tags used

-   `audio` and `source`: The `audio` tag is used to embed an audio clip on the website. The `source` tag is used within the `audio` tag to specify the source of the audio file.
-   `video` and `source`: The `video` tag is used to embed a video clip on the website. The `source` tag is used within the `video` tag to specify the source of the video file.
-   `header`: The `header` tag is used to create a header section on the website, which typically contains the site title and navigation menu.
-   `nav`: The `nav` tag is used to create a navigation menu within the header section.
-   `main`: The `main` tag is used to create the main content section of the website.
-   `section`: The `section` tag is used to divide the main content into sections, making it easier to organize the content and improve visual appeal.
-   `footer`: The `footer` tag is used to create a footer section on the website, which typically contains the site's copyright information.

### External CSS file

An external CSS file named `style.css` is also used to style the website. It includes the styles for different elements like body, header, main, section, footer etc. which provides a consistent look and feel throughout the website.
